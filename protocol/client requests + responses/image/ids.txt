Clients can request the ids of all public images owned by a certain user, the request must contain:
CTS_CODE_IMAGE (as sized uint of size CTS_CODE_BITS)
IMAGE_IDS (as sized uint of size IMAGE_CODE_BITS)
The id of the user to get the image ids of (as var uint)

If the request was successful, the server will send the following response:
true (as boolean)
SUCCESS (as sized uint of size IDS_CODE_BITS)
The number of public images (as var uint)
The ids of the public images (as sequence of var uints with the number of public images as size)

If the request was not successful, the server will send the following response:
true (as boolean)
NO_ACCOUNT (as sized uint of size IDS_CODE_BITS)

CTS_CODE_BITS = 2
CTS_CODE_IMAGE = 2
IMAGE_CODE_BITS = 3
IMAGE_IDS = 6

IDS_CODE_BITS = 1
SUCCESS = 0
NO_ACCOUNT = 1

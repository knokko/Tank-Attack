The client can request to copy an image to its own account, the request must contain:
CTS_CODE_IMAGE (as sized uint of size CTS_CODE_BITS)
IMAGE_COPY (as sized uint of size IMAGE_CODE_BITS)
The id of the source image (as var uint)
The private status of the destination image (as boolean)
The name of the destination image (as string)

If the copy was successful, the server will send the following response:
true (as boolean)
SUCCESS (as sized uint of size COPY_CODE_BITS)
The id of the destination image (as var uint)
The createdAt of the destination image (number of milliseconds between exact moment of creation and Epoch, as var uint)

Additionally, the server will broadcast a message to all currently connected clients (except the client that sent this request)
that the image ids of the client user have changed. If the other clients are interested, they should send an ids request.

If the copy failed, the server will send the following response:
true (as boolean)
IO_ERROR_READ or IO_ERROR_WRITE or UNAUTHORIZED or NO_IMAGE or MANY_TOTAL or MANY_YOU (as sized uint of size COPY_CODE_BITS)

CTS_CODE_BITS = 2
CTS_CODE_IMAGE = 2

IMAGE_COPY = 5

COPY_CODE_BITS = 3
SUCCESS = 0
IO_ERROR_READ = 1
IO_ERROR_WRITE = 2
UNAUTHORIZED = 3
NO_IMAGE = 4
MANY_TOTAL = 5
MANY_YOU = 6

The client can request the server to send the metadata of an image, the request must contain:
CTS_CODE_IMAGE (as sized uint of size CTS_CODE_BITS)
IMAGE_GET_META (as sized uint of size IMAGE_CODE_BITS)
The image id (as var uint)

If the request was successful, the server will send the following response:
true (as boolean)
SUCCESS (as sized uint of size GET_META_CODE_BITS)
The private status of the image (as boolean)
The name of the image (as string)
The createdAt of the image (the number of milliseconds that passed between that time and the Epoch, as var uint)
The lastModified of the image (same encoding as createdAt)

If the request was not successful, the server will send the following response:
true (as boolean)
UNAUTHORIZED or NO_IMAGE (as sized uint of size GET_META_CODE_BITS)

CTS_CODE_BITS = 2
CTS_CODE_IMAGE = 2
IMAGE_CODE_BITS = 3
IMAGE_GET_META = 4

GET_META_CODE_BITS = 2
SUCCESS = 0
UNAUTHORIZED = 1
NO_IMAGE = 2

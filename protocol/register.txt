The client can send a register request, it must contain only CODE_REGISTER as int8

If the account was created successfully, the server response will contain:
true (boolean)
SUCCESS (sized uint of size CODE_BITS)
The id of the new account (as var uint)
The password of the new account (as uint8 sequence of length PASSWORD_LENGTH)

If the account was not created successfully, the server response will contain:
true (boolean)
the error code (sized uint of size CODE_BITS)

The error code must be MAX_ACCOUNTS_REACHED or RANDOM_ERROR

If the client was already logged in, the server will terminate the connection instead

SUCCESS = 0
MAX_ACCOUNTS_REACHED = 1
RANDOM_ERROR = 2

CODE_BITS = 2
PASSWORD_LENGTH = 64

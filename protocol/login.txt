The login protocol is started by the client.

The client to server message contains:
CODE_LOGIN (int8)
The account id to log in with (var_u64)
The password (a sequence of uint8's of length PASSWORD_LENGTH)

CODE_LOGIN = 1
PASSWORD_LENGTH = 64

The server response code will be one of the following:
-SUCCESS if the login was succesful
-ALREADY_LOGGED_IN if the account with the given account id is already logged in
-WRONG_PASSWORD if the password sent by the client is not correct
-NO_ACCOUNT if there is no account with the given account id

The server response will contain:
true (boolean) because this is a response
the response code as sized uint with size LOGIN_CODE_BITS

The server will terminate the connection instead if the client was already in the logged in state when it received the request.

SUCCESS = 0
ALREADY_LOGGED_IN = 1
NO_ACCOUNT = 2
WRONG_PASSWORD = 3

LOGIN_CODE_BITS = 2

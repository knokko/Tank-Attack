The client can request the pixel data of an image. The request must contain:
CODE_IMAGE (as sized uint of size CTS_CODE_BITS)
IMAGE_GET_PIXELS (as sized uint of size IMAGE_CODE_BITS)
The image id (as var uint)

If the server accepts the request, it will send the following response:
true (as boolean)
SUCCESS (as sized uint of size GET_CODE_BITS)
The width of the image - 1 (as uint8)
The height of the image - 1 (as uint8)
The pixel rgba data of the image (as uint8 sequence of length width * height * 4)

If the server does not accept the request, it will send the following response:
true (as boolean)
IO_ERROR or UNAUTHORIZED or NO_IMAGE (as sized uint of size GET_CODE_BITS)

CTS_CODE_BITS = 2
CODE_IMAGE = 2
IMAGE_CODE_BITS = 3
IMAGE_GET_PIXELS = 2

GET_CODE_BITS = 2
SUCCESS = 0
IO_ERROR = 1
UNAUTHORIZED = 2
NO_IMAGE = 3

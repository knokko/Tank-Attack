The client can request to change the metadata (currently name and private status) of an image, the request must contain:
CODE_IMAGE (as sized uint of size CTS_CODE_BITS)
IMAGE_CHANGE_META (as sized uint of size IMAGE_CODE_BITS)
The id of the image to change (as var uint)
The new private status (as boolean)
The new name (as string)

The server will send the following response:
true (as boolean)
SUCCESS or UNAUTHORIZED or NO_IMAGE (as sized uint of size CHANGE_META_CODE_BITS)

CTS_CODE_BITS = 2
CODE_IMAGE = 2
IMAGE_CODE_BITS = 3
IMAGE_CHANGE_META = 3

CHANGE_META_CODE_BITS = 2
SUCCESS = 0
UNAUTHORIZED = 1
NO_IMAGE = 2

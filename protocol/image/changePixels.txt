The client can request to change the pixel data and/or size of an image. It must contain:
CODE_IMAGE (as sized uint of size CTS_CODE_BITS)
CHANGE_PIXELS (as sized uint of size IMAGE_CODE_BITS)
The id of the image to change (as var uint)
The new width - 1 (as uint8)
The new height - 1 (as uint8)
The new pixel data (as uint8 sequence of size 4 * width * height)

The server will send the following response:
true (as boolean)
SUCCESS or IO_ERROR or UNAUTHORIZED or NO_IMAGE (as sized uint of size IMAGE_CHANGE_CODE_BITS)

Additionally, the server will broadcast the following message to all currently connected clients:
false (as boolean)
STC_CODE_IMAGE (as sized uint of size STC_CODE_BITS)
STC_IMAGE_CHANGE (as sized uint of size STC_IMAGE_CODE_BITS)
The image id (as var uint)

All currently connected clients that are interested in the received image id, can send a getPixels message to
the server to ask for the new pixel data.

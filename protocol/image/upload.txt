The client can request to upload an image. The message must contain the following:
CODE_IMAGE (as int8)
UPLOAD (as sized uint of size IMAGE_CODE_BITS)
Whether or not the image is private (boolean)
The name of the image (as string, null is not allowed)
The width of the image - 1 (as uint8)
The height of the image - 1 (as uint8)
The pixel data in rgba format (as uint8 sequence of size width * height * 4)

If the upload was successful, the server will send the following response:
true (as boolean)
SUCCESS (as sized uint of size UPLOAD_CODE_BITS)
The id of the new image (as var uint)
The createdAt time of the image (as var uint)

If the upload was not successful, the server will send the following response:
true (as boolean)
IO_ERROR or LONG_NAME or MANY_TOTAL or MANY_YOU (1 of them as sized uint of size UPLOAD_CODE_BITS)

SUCCESS = 0
IO_ERROR = 1
LONG_NAME = 2
MANY_TOTAL = 3
MANY_YOU = 4

IMAGE_CODE_BITS = 3
UPLOAD_CODE_BITS = 3

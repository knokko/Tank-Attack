The frontend will open a websocket connection when it wants to log in or register.
When this happens, it will send the corresponding message as soon as the connection opens.

For Client to Server messages (cts):
The first sized uint of size CTS_CODE_BITS denotes the message type (for instance LOGIN, REGISTER or IMAGE)
The rest of the message depends entirely on the message type and payload

For Server to Client messages (stc):
The first boolean denotes whether the message is a response or a server initiative.
-If it is true, the server is responding to a message sent by the client. This message responds to the earliest message sent
by the client that was not yet responded to. Then there is no additional header, but the payload comes immediathly after the true.
-If it is false, the message is not a response to a client message, but the server informs the client that something changed.
Then, the first sized uint of size STC_CODE_BITS denotes the message type. The rest of the message is then the payload.

The folder 'client requests + responses' contains the protocols for the client to server messages and the corresponding server response.
The folder 'server updates' contains the protocols for messages from server to client that are not a responses to requests of that client.

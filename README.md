A game I am creating for fun and to practice with Rust and React

To try this project locally, you will need npm and Cargo.
To get started, first clone this repository. Then open a terminal in the frontend folder and run 'npm update'.
The previous step should only be necessary the first time and after a dependency needs an update.

To start the frontend, open a terminal in the frontend folder and run 'npm start'.

To start the backend, open a terminal in the backend folder and run 'cargo run'.
